# Simple Template Renderer

Simple Template Renderer is just that: a very simple tool that can take a file or directory, perform some key-value-pair find/replace on file names and file text, and write the result to a specified location.

## This is a `dotnet tool` on NuGet.org

To get started with using this library as a `dotnet tool`, check out the [NuGet page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/simple-template-renderer/).

Check out the MSDN docs on [global](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) vs. [local](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/local-tools-how-to-use) dotnet tools and set up your environment accordingly.

Once installed, call `simple-template-renderer --help` to see the options that are available.
